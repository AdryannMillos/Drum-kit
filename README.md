This is an exercise from the App Brewery. There are 3 main goals:
1- Make "each part of the instrument" play the right sound.
2- Active the sounds by click or keyboard.
3- Make a little animation for the respective part of the intrument, when the sound is played.

The main tools used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

With this exercise i learned more about DOM, eventlisteners and to manipulate more the HTML with JavaScript.
